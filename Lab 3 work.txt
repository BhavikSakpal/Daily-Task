1. Python program to check leap year
code:
# Program to check if a year is a leap year
def is_leap_year(year):
    # A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100,
    # unless it is also divisible by 400.
    if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
        return True
    return False

# Take year input from the user

code:
# Program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero

# Take input from the user
try:

 4. Atoy vendor supplies three types of toys: Battery Based Toys, Key-based
 Toys, and Electrical Charging Based Toys. The vendor gives a discount of
 10% on orders for battery-based toys if the order is for more than Rs. 1000.
 On orders of more than Rs. 100 for key-based toys, a discount of 5% is
 given, and a discount of 10% is given on orders for electrical charging based
 toys of value more than Rs. 500. Assume that the numeric codes 1,2 and 3
 are used for battery based toys, key-based toys, and electrical charging based
 toys respectively. Write a program that reads the product code and the order
 amount and prints out the net amount that the customer is required to pay
 after the discount.
code:
# Program to calculate net amount after discount

def calculate_discount(product_code, order_amount):
    if product_code == 1:  # Battery Based Toys
        if order_amount > 1000:
            discount = 0.10 * order_amount
        else:
            discount = 0
    elif product_code == 2:  # Key-based Toys
        if order_amount > 100:
            discount = 0.05 * order_amount
        else:
            discount = 0
    elif product_code == 3:  # Electrical Charging Based Toys
        if order_amount > 500:
            discount = 0.10 * order_amount
        else:
            discount = 0
    else:
        discount = 0
        print("Invalid product code.")
    return order_amount - discount

try:
    # Input product code and order amount
    product_code = int(input("Enter the product code (1-Battery, 2-Key, 3-Electrical): "))
    order_amount = float(input("Enter the order amount (Rs.): "))

    if order_amount < 0:
        print("Order amount cannot be negative.")
    else:
        # Calculate net amount
        net_amount = calculate_discount(product_code, order_amount)
        print(f"The net amount to be paid is: Rs. {net_amount:.2f}")

except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input! Please enter numeric values for product code and order amount.")

 5. Atransport company charges the fare according to following table:
|Distance	|	Charges    |
|--------------------------------------------|
|1-50		|	8 Rs/km   |
|51-100	|	10 Rs/km | 
|>100		|	12 Rs/km |
code:
# Program to calculate transport fare based on distance traveled

def calculate_fare(distance):
    if 1 <= distance <= 50:
        fare = distance * 8
    elif 51 <= distance <= 100:
        fare = distance * 10
    elif distance > 100:
        fare = distance * 12
    else:
        fare = 0  # Invalid distance
        print("Distance must be greater than 0.")
    return fare

try:
    # Input the distance traveled
    distance = float(input("Enter the distance traveled (in km): "))

    if distance <= 0:
        print("Distance must be greater than 0.")
    else:
        # Calculate fare
        total_fare = calculate_fare(distance)
        print(f"The total fare for {distance:.2f} km is: Rs. {total_fare:.2f}")

except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input! Please enter a numeric value for distance.")
